    Hey. I'm a software developer, currently <del>working at</del> in sabbatical.
  </p>

  <p>
    I love writing changeable, testable code, as well as engaging with the
    product to help deliver valuable solutions. I can't stand unnecessary
    bureaucracyâ€” not the kind that supports the foundation, but the kind that
    prevents growth and causes pain. I try to challenge the status quo, but it
    might seem like I'm sabotaging the project.
